### Results and Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- Fruits accounted for 67% of total revenue while vegetables generated 33%.
- The United States emerged as the most prominent market for both fruits and vegetables. Other notable regions included France and Australia for fruits, and the UK and Germany for vegetables.
- Bananas were the most purchased fruit across all countries, especially in the US, France, and Australia. Also, cabbage was the leading vegetable, with notable demand in the US, UK, and Germany.
- The highest sales and order volumes occurred in May, indicating a significant seasonal peak during this month.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:
- Focus on expanding the customer base in underperforming regions like New Zealand and Canada to reduce dependency on the US market. This could involve localized marketing campaigns and partnerships with regional distributors.
- Implement promotional campaigns during May to capitalize on peak demand, such as discounts or special offers on popular products like bananas and cabbages.
- Ensure adequate supply of high-demand products such as bananas and cabbages to meet consumer needs, especially during peak months. Additionally, explore complementary products to increase cross-selling opportunities.
